# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

Your answer: is a set of specified instructions for a piece of code to run

Researched answer: A function is set of instructions detailing how to a task. We can use the set of instructions over and over again.

2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

Your answer: .map() runs through the length of the code while the .filter() is meant to find a piece of code and take it out.

Researched answer: .map iterates its elements in insertion order while .filter goes through the values that pass the test and if none pass the test a blank result is returned.

3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

Your answer: console.log() is used to return an output in the terminal while return is used in a function to return a a specified task

Researched answer: the return statement ends the function execution and specifies a value that is to be returned while the console.log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.

4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

Your answer: an argument is a set of instructions

Researched answer: the parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations. If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Theres two roles driver and navigator.
Driver: -Types the code that is instructed, and gives suggestions about where to take the code.
Navigator: -Gives direction to driver about the type of code that needs to be put into the coding environment and watches for mistakes of the driver.

Researched answer:
Driver:
-Write the code according to the navigator's specification
-Listen intently to the navigators instructions
-Ask questions wherever there is a lack of clarity
-Offer alternative solutions if you disagree with the navigator
-Where there is disagreement, defer to the navigator. If their idea fails, get to failure quickly and move on
-Make sure code is clean
-Ignore larger issues and focus on the task at hand
-Trust the navigator - ultimately the navigator has the final say in what is written
-You are writing the code

Navigator:
-Dictates the code that is to be written - the 'what'
-Clearly communicates what code to write
-Explains 'why' they have chosen the particular solution to this problem
-Check for syntax / type errors as the Driver drives
-Be the safety net for the driver
-Make sure that the driver sticks to the small task at hand
-Outline and note down high level tasks / issues
-Ongoing code review

6. What is iteration?

Your answer: its a string of code that repeats itself as many times its asked.

Researched answer: theyre methods that operate on every item in an array, one at a time. These methods are closely associated with loops.

7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

Your answer: You get to make new files or get to the information youre looking for faster withouth having to open new program windows.

Researched answer: One of the main advantages of a command line interface is that it allows users to type in commands that can produce immediate results.f you know the commands,
-can be a lot faster and efficient than any other type of interface. It can also handle repetitive tasks easily.
-requires less memory to use in comparison to other interfaces. It also does not use as much CPU processing time as other interfaces.
-doesnâ€™t require Windows and a low-resolution monitor can be used. Meaning, it needs fewer resources, yet is highly precise.

Disadvantage:
-If youre new to programming you may not know the right way to use the commands and may delete a file by accident
=If a command is misspelled sometimes you may have to start from the beggining

8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?

Your answer: That we could ask question about the code that was being taught and we could get live feedback.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- Jest :Used to test
  -Jest is used for testing frameworks to ensure the correcxtness of any Javascript codebase.
- Test Driven Development:
  -Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
- Classes:
  -Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
- React:
  -React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies
- React State:
  -The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component.
- CRUD:
  -It stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE AND DELETE
